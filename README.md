# DSA-Problems
This repository contains my Data Structures and Algorithms practice problems.  I am currently learning and improving my problem-solving skills using C++ and Python.  The solutions here are part of my regular learning and help me to understand core concepts.

This repository contains the Data Structures and Algorithms problems I am solving as part of my learning journey.
I am currently in my second year of Computer Engineering, and I use this repo to practice coding and improve logic.

## Why this repo?
- To track my daily/weekly practice
- To improve problem-solving skills
- To keep all my DSA solutions in one place
- To build a strong foundation for future placements

More problems will be added as I continue learning.
