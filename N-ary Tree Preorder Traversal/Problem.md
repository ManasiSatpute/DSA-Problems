# Leetcode 589: N-ary Tree Preorder Traversal

## Problem Statement
Given the root of an **n-ary tree**, return the **preorder traversal** of its nodes' values.

In a **preorder traversal**, we visit the root node first, followed by its children from left to right recursively.

The **N-ary tree input** is serialized in **level-order** traversal, where each group of children is separated by `null`.

---

## Inputs / Outputs

**Input:**  
- `root`: the root node of an n-ary tree.  
- Serialized in level-order, with `null` indicating separation of children.

**Output:**  
- A list of integers representing the **preorder traversal** of the tree nodes.

---

## Examples

**Example 1:**
Input: root = [1,null,3,2,4,null,5,6]
Output: [1,3,5,6,2,4]


**Example 2:**
Input: root = [1,null,2,3,4,5,null,null,6,7,null,8,null,9,10,null,null,11,null,12,null,13,null,null,14]
Output: [1,2,3,6,7,11,14,4,8,12,5,9,13,10]


---

## Constraints
- The number of nodes in the tree: `[0, 10^4]`  
- Node values: `0 <= Node.val <= 10^4`  
- Tree height: `<= 1000`  

---

## Notes
- Preorder traversal: **root → children (left to right recursively)**.  
- Pay attention to **null separators** in level-order serialization.  
- Edge cases: empty tree (`root = null`) should return `[]`.
