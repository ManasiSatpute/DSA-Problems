# N-Repeated Element in Size 2N Array

## Problem Statement

You are given an integer array `nums` of size `2N`.

There is exactly **one element** that is repeated **N times**, while the other `N` elements are **distinct**.

Your task is to **find and return the element that is repeated N times**.

---

## Input Format

- An integer array `nums` of size `2N`
- `1 ≤ N ≤ 5000`
- `0 ≤ nums[i] ≤ 10000`

---

## Output Format

- Return the integer that appears **N times**

---

## Example 1

**Input**
nums = [1,2,3,3]
Output: 3


---

## Constraints

- Exactly one element appears `N` times
- All other elements appear exactly once
- The array size is always even

---

## Notes

- The problem guarantees that a valid answer always exists.
- Efficient solutions can be achieved using hashing or set-based approaches.
