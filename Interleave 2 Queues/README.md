# Interleave Queue Using STL (C++)

## Overview

This project demonstrates how to **interleave the first half and second half of a queue** using **C++ STL queues**.  
The solution works for queues with an **even number of elements** and preserves the relative order of elements within each half.

This is a classic **data structures problem** that tests understanding of queue operations and auxiliary space usage.

##  Problem Summary

Given a queue of integers with even length:

- Split the queue into two halves
- Interleave elements from both halves
- Modify the original queue to reflect the interleaved order

##  Example

### Input
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10

### Output
1 6 2 7 3 8 4 9 5 10
